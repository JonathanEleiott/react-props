# Props - a way to pass information from one component to another component

- you can only pass information down (from parent to child)
- create in key/value pairs
  - key=value
- on the component receiving the props, it will come in as an object in the parameters
  - most commonly named props
  - we can destructure the object to get the keys we need

## ternary - JS if/else statement that has special syntax

- condition ? true : false

## Conditional Rendering - only show something if a certain condition is met
